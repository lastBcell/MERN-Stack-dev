    <h1>Most Indian districts recording extremely humid heat during monsoon: Report</h1>
    <p>Over 84% of Indian districts are prone to extreme heat waves and most of India’s districts have been recording extremely humid heat even during the monsoon months of June, July, and September, a report titled “Managing Monsoons in a Warming Climate” released on Tuesday ahead of the NYC (New York City) Climate Week in September has said. As many as 70% of the districts facing extreme heat also faced increased frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall.</p>
    <p>The IPE Global (international development consulting group) and Esri India (geographic information systems solutions provider) report said the frequency, intensity, and unpredictability of extreme heat and rainfall events have risen in recent decades.There was a 15-fold increase in extreme heat wave days across the March-April-May (MAM) and June-July-August-September (JJAS) months in the last three decades in India. The country has faced a 19-fold increase in extreme heat wave days in the last decade, found the study based on climate modelling and observed data from the Indian Space Research Organisation, India Meteorological Department, and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts.</p>

    <p>IPE Global said the study found India was witnessing extended summer-like conditions except on non-rainy days in monsoons. Abinash Mohanty, IPE Global climate change and sustainability practice head who authored the study, said the current trend of catastrophic extreme heat and rainfall events is a result of a 0.6°C temperature rise in the last century. “El Nino [associated with ocean surface warming in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean] is gaining momentum and making its early presence felt across the globe with India facing the extreme events of turbulence more in patterns than waves,” he said in a statement on Tuesday.</p>
