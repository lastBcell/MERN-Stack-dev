    <p>If our scriptures are not safe in our own land, how can we expect their sanctity will be preserved elsewhere?” he said.

        Mann said that the turn of events that had brought an abrupt end to prime minister Sheikh Hasina’s 15-year-old rule in Bangladesh had taught the lesson that authoritarian rule could not last forever. “There is a limit to people’s tolerance. You cannot go on nursing your own ambitions and feeding your own families. There is a lesson to be learnt from the way angry people ransacked the Bangladesh prime minister’s house and did not even spare her pets. Wisdom lies in staying in touch with the public and working for them,” he said.
        
        The chief minister inaugurated the state-level Van Mahotsav by planting a sapling at the community centre in Hoshiarpur. He was accompanied by state forest minister Lal Chand Kataruchak, revenue minister Brahm Shankar Jimpa and Member of Parliament Raj Kumar Chabbewal. He said that there was a plan to plant three crore saplings across the state this year under the state’s green initiative.</p>
